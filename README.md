# Munir Khakhi's Personal Website and Blog

This repository contains Munir Khakhi's personal website and an integrated blog.

## Local Development Setup

To run this project locally, you need to set up both the main website and the blog.

### 1. Main Website

The main website (`index.html`) is a static page. You can open `index.html` directly in your browser or serve it using any simple local HTTP server.

For example, using Python:
```bash
# Serve the current directory on port 8000
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
Then access it at `http://localhost:8000`.
