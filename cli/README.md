# Munir Khakhi's Portfolio

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website.

## Running Locally

To test the website locally, you'll need a web server. The simplest way to do this is to use Python's built-in HTTP server.

1.  **Open your terminal or command prompt.**
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/munir131.github.io
    ```
3.  **Start a simple Python HTTP server:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m http.server 8000
    ```
    (If you have an older Python version, you might need to use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`.)
4.  **Open your web browser** and go to:
    ```
    http://localhost:8000
    ```

You should see the website with the typing animation working.
